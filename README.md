**Author:** Aneef Sheriff <br>
**Course:** CSN 190 - Cybersecurity Project  
**Semester:** Fall 2025 
**Institution:** Bronx Community College

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop an automated vulnerability assessment tool that streamlines the process of identifying, analyzing, and reporting security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.

## Software/Tools Used
- VS Code
- Python

## Key Deliverables
- [Medium Article](link when published)
- [Tutorial](04.docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)
- [Video Demonstration](YouTube link)

## Repository Navigation
- `/weekly-progress/` - All weekly assignments and progress updates
- `/resources/` - Compiled research sources and bibliography
- `/src/` - Source code and project files
- `/docs/` - Technical documentation and guides
- `/final-paper/` - Research papers and articles
- `/images/` - Screenshots and visual documentation

## Getting Started
The scanner successfully identifies common vulnerabilities such as default credentials, enabled debug modes, and weak authentication policies. Its lightweight design allows integration into DevSecOps pipelines. Future enhancements include CVE database integration and multi-threaded scanning for large-scale systems.

## Results Summary
This project has taught me what goes into the process of creating a vulnerability scanner using Python. Before this, I never had to use Python as much as I did. In the process, I gained a deeper understanding of Python and how libraries work and how to implement them into a Pythion project. I also learned about API keys and how they are used when coding an application.
