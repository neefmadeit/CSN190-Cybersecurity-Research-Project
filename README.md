**Course:** CSN 190 - Cybersecurity Project  
**Semester:** Fall 2025 
**Institution:** Bronx Community College

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop an automated vulnerability assessment tool that streamlines the process of identifying, analyzing, and reporting security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.

## Software/Tools Used
- VS Code
- Python

## Key Deliverables
- [Medium Article](link when published)
- [Tutorial](04.docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)

## Repository Navigation
- `/weekly-progress/` - All weekly assignments and progress updates
- `/resources/` - Compiled research sources and bibliography
- `/src/` - Source code and project files
- `/docs/` - Technical documentation and guides
- `/final-paper/` - Research papers and articles
- `/images/` - Screenshots and visual documentation

## Getting Started
For those seeking flexibility, deeper understanding, or a hands-on approach, building your own vulnerability scanner can be both an educational and empowering experience. By creating a custom tool, you gain full control over its functionality, enabling you to tailor scanning techniques, reporting formats, and integration options to meet specific organizational or research needs. Beyond technical skills, this project offers valuable insights into how vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited, strengthening your overall security expertise. 

## Results Summary
This project has taught me what goes into the process of creating a vulnerability scanner using Python. Before this, I never had to use Python as much as I did. In the process, I gained a deeper understanding of Python and how libraries work and how to implement them into a Pythion project. I also learned about API keys and how they are used when coding an application.
