### GitHub Software Tutorial 
The GitHub project I am using is a network scanning tool called Astsu. The purpose of the tool is to scan common ports that are open, discover hosts that are on the network, and discover what operating systems the devices are running. This tool is interesting because it gives you the ability to probe devices on a network and see which ones are vulnerable.

### Prerequisites 
- Windows or Linux OS. Mac OS support is pending 
- Install VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Step-by-Step Instructions 
- Step 1: Open VS Code as an administrator 
- Step 2: Cloned the repository https://github.com/ReddyyZ/astsu.git in VS Code 
- Step 3: Open a new terminal window in VS Code  
- Step 4: Run this command - python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt. (All requirements will be installed) 
- Step 5: Run this command - python3 install.py (The tool will be installed)

### Expected Results 
After step 5, the tool is now installed. You can use some of the following arguments.

### Troubleshooting 
The problem I encountered was when running the python3 install.py command, I needed to run VS Code as an administrator to install it. 

### Conclusion 
I learned how to properly clone and install all the required modules for a GitHub repository. This tool can be used for reconnaissance and pen testing. I did not encounter any limitations or warnings.
