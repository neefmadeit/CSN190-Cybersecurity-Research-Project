## Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool Development (Project - Build Python tool) 
Test
My final topic choice is the topic Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool Development. This topic is project-based and requires me to develop, test, and deploy a Python tool that automates vulnerability assessments. This topic will be challenging because I never had to develop a Python tool before, but I am confident that I will be able to develop this tool. With my experience from using Python last semester, I will be able to use what I learned so far and combine it with the added information that I am learning while researching this topic and use them both create the Python tool that is required to complete this project. 

The ideal outcome I would like to obtain is that I finished the Python tool. After doing my research and locating the resources that I need, I do not see any reason I should not be able to finish the tool. I plan to work on this tool every day for at least 30 minutes until it is completed. With my efforts, I will learn the skill of developing a tool in Python, seeing how a vulnerability database is used to check for vulnerabilities, and how systems are checked for such vulnerabilities. 

After finishing the project, my coding skills, vulnerability assessments, and remediating system skills will all be improved. I also plan to show the Python tool I built on GitHub, to publicly share what I learned, but also highlight my coding skills. Even if I do not finish the project, the information that I researched has already proved invaluable and I have gained a deep understanding of the Cybersecurity industry. I am excited and looking forward to doing this project and graduating from college!
