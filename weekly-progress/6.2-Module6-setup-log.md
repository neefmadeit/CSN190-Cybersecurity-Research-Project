## Setup and Deploy First Project 
The GitHub project that I cloned was a network scanning tool called Astsu that was developed by the user ReddyyZ. The purpose of the tool is to scan common ports that are open, discover hosts that are on the network, and discover what operating systems the devices are running. By using this tool, you can see what devices are vulnerable that are currently on the network. 

I got it running by following these steps: 

Cloned this repository  https://github.com/ReddyyZ/astsu.git in VS Code  

Installed python 3 for windows 

The ran these commands in the VS Code terminal window: 

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

python3 install.py 

The problem I encountered was when running the python3 install.py command, I needed to run VS Code as an administrator inorder for it to install. 

I learned how to properly clone and install all the required modules for a GitHub repository. I did not use any AI during the setup process.
