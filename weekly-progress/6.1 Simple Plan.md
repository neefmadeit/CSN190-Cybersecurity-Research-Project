##Simple Plan 

1. This research is primarily project-based. I would need to build a Python tool, and that would be my deliverable. This topic addresses the potential of human error and the man hours it takes to run a vulnerability assessment. This fulfills the need to perform regular assessments of your environment, and companies will have the ability to run scans on demand. 

2. I will build an automated vulnerability assessment tool using Python software and language. I will be using existing GitHub projects to help me build this tool, and I will also use AI tools to help me write the code. 

3. Ambitious Goal: I would like to accomplish the goal of finishing the Python tool and use it to highlight my coding skills in Python. 

Realistic Target: I will work on developing this tool daily. I have a home lab environment setup and Python installed. I don’t see any reason why I cannot finish this project in 4 weeks. 

Minimum Goal: Even if I do not finish this project, I will learn the necessary steps it takes to develop a tool in Python. 

##Simple Timeline (4 weeks remaining) 

Break your work into focused phases, replace items below with specifics.  What software or tools are you using: 

1: Get Started and Make Progress 

Set up my coding environment using Python 

Start coding the vulnerability assessment tool 

Get something concrete done this week 

My deliverable is a vulnerability assessment tool 

2: Push Forward 

Continue main development 

Complete core functionality 

Test what I've built  

My deliverable is a vulnerability assessment tool 

3: Finish and Polish 

Complete remaining work 

Test/refine everything 

Start documentation and paper writing 

My deliverable is a vulnerability assessment tool 

4: Finalize Everything 

Complete your paper 

Prepare your presentation 

Final testing/validation 

Submit everything
