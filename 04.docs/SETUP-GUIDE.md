## Setup and Deploy First Project 
The GitHub project that I cloned was a penetration-testing-toolkit that was developed by the user Sharma-IT. It is a comprehensive cybersecurity tool for automated security assessments and vulnerability scanning. 

I got it running by following these steps: 

1) Cloned this repository https://github.com/Sharma-IT/penetration-testing-toolkit in VS Code

2) Issued these commands to copilot to get it running. 

+ Get this GitHub repo http://github.com/Sharma-IT/penetration-testing-toolkit running on my computer

+ It installed all the requirements that was listed in the requirments.txt file  

3) After that, I told copilot to run a test with target http://demo.testfire.net

I did not encounter any problems when installing this tool. 

 I learned how to properly clone and install all the required modules for a GitHub repository. The AI chat bot was very helpful. I asked it to get the GitHub repository running, and it did just that.
