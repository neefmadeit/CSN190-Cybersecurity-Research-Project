### GitHub Repos
## Topic 1: Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool Development (Project - Build Python tool) 
### GitHub Project 1:  
- Citation: dragon404-git. (2025). Vulnerability-Scanning-Toolkit. GitHub. 
- Type: Security Analysis Tool 
- Synopsis: This toolkit combines multiple security scanning tools into a single menu-driven Python script, featuring Nmap, WhatWeb, DNSRecon, GoBuster, and CVE search capabilities. Perfect for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and security enthusiasts who want a unified interface for common recon tasks. 
- Link: https://github.com/dragon404-git/Vulnerability-Scanning-Toolkit-/tree/main 
- Relevance: 5/5: This project gives me a great example of what a python script should look like when developing a scanning tool, and the software needed. I am familiar with some of the software needed and I am excited to do the project. 

### GitHub Project 2:  
- Citation: PollaMohith. (2025). Automated-Network-Vulnerability-Security-Assessment-Tool. GitHub. 
- Type: Security Analysis Tool 
- Synopsis: This Python script automates network scanning using Nmap and extracts vulnerability information such as CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). It outputs the results into a structured CSV file for easy analysis.

### GitHub Project 2:  
- Citation: Lerato Letsepe. (2025). ai-powered-phishing-email-detection-system. GitHub. 
- Type: Security Analysis Tool 
- Synopsis: This project is an AI-Powered Phishing Email Detection System designed to classify emails as either legitimate or phishing attempts. It features a web-based interface allowing users to input email content (sender, subject, body) or upload an email file. Users can choose between two AI models for classification: a traditional Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) model and a fine-tuned BERT-mini transformer model. The system also provides explainability for the AI's decisions.
